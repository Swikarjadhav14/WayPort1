# Laptop Dashboard

## Project Description

The Laptop Dashboard is a web application designed to display and manage laptop specifications. Built using React for the frontend and Node.js with MySQL for the backend, this application allows users to view laptop details with pagination, filtering, and sorting options. The dashboard fetches data from a MySQL database and provides a user-friendly interface for navigating through various laptop models.

## Features

- **Pagination**: Navigate through pages of laptop records (10, 20, 50, 100 items per page).
- **Filtering**: Filter laptops based on various specifications.
- **Sorting**: Sort laptops by different attributes (e.g., price, RAM).
- **Notification**: Alerts users when new records are added to the database.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
